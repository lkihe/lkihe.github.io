This semester from January to May, I took the ICS 314 class at the University of Hawaii at Manoa. I feel as if I have learned a ton about the actual process in programming. Not only did I learn how creating a website works but I even learned about managing and working in a programming project. 

There is so much I can talk about when it comes to this sort of upper level programming. Personally I never really cared about things like design patterns, and focusing on what framework I'm using, or how I am following coding standards or how I manage projects. I would take what I need for my assignments and little projects but because I never really tried to make a website or participated in a group setting I never really cared about how I coded. If it worked, it was enough. This class however, especially when it came to working on the final project, I learned how to use github as an organization, and using NextJS, Vercel and databases from scratch and with a final project goal in mind. It was really polarizing to use and learn all of those concepts.

Here are some of my thoughts on the various topics I learned from this class.

## Coding Standards

I remember I wrote an essay about coding standards. I also remember my strong opinion about coding standards. I don’t really like how the program would overall refuse to compile and run when I don’t put an ending trailing new line at the end of the file. I still hate that but I do understand it more, especially when with a team. Spacing requirements being the same for all team members made reading code made by other teammates *way* easier to read. If my code and my teammate’s code are following the same rules, I know what to expect from my teammates.

## Design Standards

I think there is a link from Coding Standards to Design Standards in what they are overall able to accomplish. It is to have people be able to understand others code easier by having everybody code in a similar way, but design patterns are more for planning on how files would interact with each other or what do files do in the overall program. Coding Standards are for how files are written while Design Standards are for what files do. Still, Design Standards are important to have people know what is happening. Personally with my team we all decided we had to implement some sort of standard on how we would implement our features, especially when they would interact with each other. When we are finished we can simply point out where our files are and maybe a small explanation and everyone would understand what the file does and how it is interacting with other files.
Overall, ICS 314 has significantly shifted my perspective on software development. Before this class, I focused mainly on getting code to work without much thought about current standards, teams, or structure. However, through doing the project with a team, I have come to appreciate the value of coding standards, design patterns, and collaborative tools like GitHub.
