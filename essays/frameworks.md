This week, I was able to learn how to create a site using html and a UI framework called bootstrap 5. Aparently its really old and theres better things I can use anyways but dispite that, I think its a very nice tool to add complexity and cool things to a site.

In fact, in a recent assignment I did, I was able to recreate the Hawaii DMV site.

## What is a UI Framework?

A UI framework, in terms of making a site is a tool that Developers use to help in the creation of making web sites. They do that by basically giving developers shortcuts to making the more complex aspects of websites. For example I was able to use the Bootstrap framework to easily create different types of things for my website such as icons or different kinds of buttons. It is really useful but I see people confuse the reason why these things are important.

## The simple thing is this: These tools don't make you suddenly able to create a complex site

It is a tool, and like any other tool, you need to learn how to actually use it. If you don't know how to use basic HTML and CSS, UI frameworks such as bootstrap is bascially worthless. Think about it. If you are unable to do something such as make text, how are you expected to make dropdowns or navbars?

When I used Bootstrap. It was hard to understand at first, but as I learned it I soon realised what its purpose is and what it can be used for. In fact, by learning it I was able to easily create more complex parts of a site that is not just buttons, links, text or other simple things. Just because something is hard to learn does not mean that it is not useful and will not make things easier as you use them in the future. That is true for all programming languages as learning more enables you to do more. 

In fact, it is like all hobbies and skills. There is always that brick wall that will make things seem impossible or not worth the time learning but also with having these skills its amazing to have them in the end and use them to create things.

I appreciate what Bootstrap was able to give me. Next week, we will be learning and using react. With react we would be able to do even more complex things when it comes to creating sites and I can't wait to use it.
