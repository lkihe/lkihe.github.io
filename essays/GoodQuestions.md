## Asking a Good Question takes a lot of Effort

It actually does. Teachers may say that every question is a good question but that is so not true. Like whne I ask some questions, I get called an idiot. So why is that? There are a lot of ways to mess up asking a question surpisingly and most of the time, you would not run into them but sometimes, when you are especially not reading the room, or forum, or classroom, whatever it is, you may ask an actual bad question which would have hte teacher kind of annoyed, you kind of annoyed and the rest of the class annoyed.
