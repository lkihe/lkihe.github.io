## Asking a Good Question takes a lot of Effort

It actually does. Teachers may say that every question is a good question but that is so not true. Like whne I ask some questions, I get called an idiot. So why is that? In the case of asking a question on a forum online, there are surprisingly a lot of ways to mess up asking a question. These people who would answer your question are not teachers who are trained to be patient and answer everything they are asked about in an understanding way. Some of these people online who would answer questions are people who would be annoyed when you waste their time. Which is why asking a valid question that they are happy to answer is important. The first thing to remember when making a good question online is to not make the answerer annoyed with it.

## What Makes a Good Question?

This question is complicated. A good question has a lot of factors in it that make it good. A Good question should be able to fit in with other good questions, have an obvious way of being answered, have never been answered before and is posted in a forum that is made to answer the type of question you are asking. 

[This is a good example of a good question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1026069/how-do-i-make-the-first-letter-of-a-string-uppercase-in-javascript)
