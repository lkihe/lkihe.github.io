## Asking a Good Question takes a lot of Effort

It actually does. Teachers may say that every question is a good question but that is so not true. Like whne I ask some questions, I get called an idiot. So why is that? In the case of asking a question on a forum online, there are surprisingly a lot of ways to mess up asking a question. These people who would answer your question are not teachers who are trained to be patient and answer everything they are asked about in an understanding way. Some of these people online who would answer questions are people who would be annoyed when you waste their time. Which is why asking a valid question that they are happy to answer is important. The first thing to remember when making a good question online is to not make the answerer annoyed with it.

## What Makes a Good Question?

This question is complicated. A good question has a lot of factors in it that make it good. A Good question should be able to fit in with other good questions, have an obvious way of being answered, have never been answered before and is posted in a forum that is made to answer the type of question you are asking. 

[This is a good example of a good question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1026069/how-do-i-make-the-first-letter-of-a-string-uppercase-in-javascript)

The Question is "How do I make the first letter of a string uppercase in JavaScript?" and it has everything needed to make a good question.

- The question about programming is posted in a programming forum (Stackoverflow)
- The question is easy to understand (That also made the answer easy to find and understand too)
- The question may have already been asked before but it is not a overly simple question that everyone should automatically know
- The question includes helpful extra informaton such as code

These points make the question good.

## The Fun Part

Bad Questions are really funny to look at and disect. They are basically exact opposites of the good question above.

### This is what I am talking about

The perfect example of a bad question
- The question is super unclear (array news? new news? what is news?)
- No extra code to show what he is even programming
- The topic is not even a question
- Extra information is not helpful (important football website)
- Unfortunate, but the fact that he does not type english well also makes it less readable

The people who actually want to answer and help people on stack overflow want easily readable questions that makes it easy to see the problem and thus makes it easy to make up a solution. The previous question was clear adn thus had a clear answer. This one just had a ton of people questioning what is even happening.

### Why is Knowing What a Good Question is Important

The answer to that one is very simple. Being able to ask good questions would make you able to clearly and effectively explain where you have trouble, and teachers or forum users can easily answer you can possible givey you solution to problems that wyou would normally never solve. Being able to give a good question can potentially give you a key to be able to get answers on not only software developemnt and programming but in pretty much every topic ever.
