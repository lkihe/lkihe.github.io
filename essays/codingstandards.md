This week we went throughand learned about the importance of coding standards, and specifically in  ICS 311, we were forced to use their own specific coding standard for all of our projects so far.

It is a way for people to collectively get together and agree on how code should be written so that everybody else can easily read it, but with this standard that I have gotten in class has really annoyed me and wasted whole *minutes* of my time so far in these assignments.
