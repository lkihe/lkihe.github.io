##What is AI and what am I doing?
Honestly I thought you would know AI. Any student knows what AI is. It is such an easy to use and versitile *thing* that has ever been made for all sorts of people to use. Having a sort of easy to use and annonymous *person* who can be abl to answer any question to even a slight degree of accuracy is super useful, but sometimes I get worried when I keep using the AI to try and help me with problems. I feel as if as a programmer, I fail to maintain a knowledgebase of what to secifically type, especially when I look back at my code and realise that I don't know what I just wrote because half of it was written by AI. Worst part is that now there is a bug... for that, just use the AI...

##Using AI in ICS 314
For my class, ICS 314, I had to do a lot of programming. Most of which could've been skipped with AI. But I know my own weaknesses. I am a very sloppy coder normally. I would throw loops and variables until I end up with a monster that would somehow complete a simple problem in 50 lines, with a for loop for every base case for some reason. I would use AI to clean up my code or fix bugs but in this class I decided to not use AI for as much of my process on homework as possible. I do remember pasting my code in Chatgpt to confirm if it is just correct but I won't try and use AI to make code from scratch.

Surprisingly enough, I was able to go this entire class until the project without using AI to code, only to confirm if my returns are aligned with the objectives. The project is where I faltered though. I knew what I wanted, I just didn't know how to implement it in NextJS. If I want rows of boxes, "How do I do that again? Whatever, use AI." If I want to make a search function, "I know that for typing a word it relates itself with every aspect of the database but I bearly know where to start typing. Whatever, just use AI." I know I should not do it but it is such an effective shortcut when it comes to typing.

##How AI harms learning
The amazing part of AI is that for the topic of how it harms learning, you get to chose for yourself how much of it harms you. Personally, I always keep in mind that planning and understanding the code always falls on me, so when describing problems to the AI, I still get to understand in some way what is happening. You can even tell it to explain what the code it is giving you does. You can always just copy and base the assignment prompt and take the first thing it gives you, then keep telling it its wrong until it wonders into the rght solution, but that is literally a brute force method of solving the problem.
