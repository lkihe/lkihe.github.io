Recently in class, we have went into writing in Typescript. Typescript is a programming language used to make programs and apps. Personally, I have used Javascript  before this and while I was slightly confused on how to specifically write the code, or the syntax. I was not confused on what to do and how to accomplish my assignments.

The fortunate thing about most programming languages like Javascript, Typescript, C++, C, and many more is that all of them can do the same basic things and create the same basic programs. That means that if you know one of them, you already know most of the others, the only difference is how you type it. An example could be this simple function in Typescript that takes a number input and returns the same number:
```typescript
function test(input: number) {
  return input;
}
```

This function can be recreated in every other language I mentioned, just with subtle changes. An example is the same function in C:
```C
int test(int input) {
  return input;
}
```
