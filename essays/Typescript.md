Recently in class, we have went into writing in Typescript. Typescript is a programming language used to make programs and apps. Personally, I have used Javascript (Typescript was based off of Javascript) way before this and while I was slightly confused on how to specifically write the code, or the syntax. I was not confused on what to do and how to accomplish my assignments.

## Do you think Typescript is a good or bad programming language from a software engineering perspective?

I think this language is a good programming language, moastly because it is easy to learn, espeically as a person comming from other languages. The fortunate thing about most programming languages like Javascript, Typescript, C++, C, and many more is that all of them can do the same basic things and create the same basic programs. That means that if you know one of them, you already know most of the others, the only difference is how you type it. An example could be this simple function in Typescript that takes a number input and returns the same number:

```typescript
function test(input: number): number {
  return input;
}
```

This function can be recreated in every other language I mentioned, just with subtle changes. An example is the same function in C:

```C
int test(int input) {
  return input;
}
```
Both of them literally do the same thing, at least to the user, but are written differently. I already have my previous experience in writting code so typescript was surprisingly easy to learn and I think a language being easy to learn for others is the best thing you can have to make a language "good".

## Did you find the practice WODs to be useful? What do you think about this style of learning?

I think that doing the practice WOD was really fun. It was super easy as it was the first one but it was nice to be able to freely talk to others in my class about coding. The other ICS classes are mostly independent so this is a good change of pace. I liked talking to my groupmates and working together to solve the problem and I would like to do it again.
