*"(TOPIC) is hard but never impossible"*

<p>
I think it is easy to just say that, that everything can just be learned and automactially mastered as long as you put effort. But anybody who has ever even wanted to try to learn something can quickly say its not as easy as just "trying". Learning new things requires going to class, taking notes, watching videos, dedicating time out of your day to learn or do homework, even setting up certain things to get started. It is a huge commitment. 
</p>

##Fun is IMPORTANT
<p>
Overall, learning a new topic requires a lot of things, but I think people forget one variable that in my opinion wildly dictates if you would learn a topic, the simple question of if you even like the topic. Of course that is also a sort of an "of course" piece of information but in every step in learning, I think it is always important to ask if you are enjoying or at least not hating what you are doing right now, and if you are, what can you do about it? Obviously, if you love a topic ad always wanted to learn it, and are even excited to learn it and spend countless hours delving into it and mastering it, the main question being answered here about how to effectively learn is already answered, but for everybdy else, we can try to figure out how to have fun while learning.

##Trying to have fun in School
<p>
If you are going to school and are finding it hard to learn, trying to make the topic fun or at least more bearable is the first goal when I notice I really don't like what I am doing or find this class super boring. Finding fun in every topic, while hard is always possible. The best way to automatically make it fun is to bring a friend. Having someone to bring along, talk to or work with to help you is 100% a huge boost not only to having fun but to learning. I think there is also the obvious but sometimes missed option of taking a break. Do a hard homework problem or study for an hour then take a break for 10-20 minutes. Sometimes you need the break, even if that means a piece of homework that can take 4 straight hours of work might need to be postponed to around 6 hours with breaks. Not only could it be less stressing but of higher quality. A tired person working for hours straight is not as productive as someone who would take a break.

##Trying to have fun learning creative topics
<p>
There are also creative projects. Drawing, modeling, programming, any sort of creative process falls into this category and are what most people would try to do in their freetime only to see either a wall of options and buttons, or see their first project look like garbage, in both cases, its very daunting and can cause someone to quit. There is one main thing you always need to remind yourself when trying these things, even if it is obvious, even if your first projects really do suck, even if after a couple days of trying your projects still suck, it is that first of all, every project is there to make you learn how to be better at your skill. Second of all, everyone would suck at their first projects. No matter what, a person who is talented at the topic you are learning had to undergo hours of learning. Third of all, when making something and comparing it to hte last time you tried making it, did you improve it? If you did, then you are already learning and improving yourself. Did your previous work look better than your current work? Then at least you made something better before, try to copy that and make it better. in not time you can improve. Constantly creating and improving upon yourself is very fun.
