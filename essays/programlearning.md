*"(TOPIC) is hard but never impossible"*

<p>
I think it is easy to just say that, that everything can just be learned and automactially mastered as long as you put effort. But anybody who has ever even wanted to try to learn something can quickly say its not as easy as just "trying". Learning new things requires going to class, taking notes, watching videos, dedicating time out of your day to learn or do homework, even setting up certain things to get started. It is a huge commitment.

Overall, learning a new topic requires a lot of things, but I think people forget one variable that in my opinion wildly dictates if you would learn a topic, the simple question of if you even like the topic. Of course that is also a sort of an "of course" piece of information but in every step in learning, I think it is always important to ask if you are enjoying or at least not hating what you are doing right now, and if you are, what can you do about it? Obviously, if you love a topic ad always wanted to learn it, and are even excited to learn it and spend countless hours delving into it and mastering it, the main question being answered here about how to effectively learn is already answered, but for everybdy else, we can try to figure out how to have fun while learning.

Even for the most fun looking topics, there will always be boring and fustrating parts. In school, having to wake up every day and travel to school to watch a lecture is always boring.
