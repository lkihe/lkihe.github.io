For my 314 class, me and my group made a website, it involved use learning how to plan using Github organizations, work with NextJS, Vercel, and learning about databases both locally and online. We learned a lot but we also decided to do the extra credit assignment about keeping tracking of how long we worked on the various issues we solved for ourselve in the project. This is the questions and my thoughts about hte process.
## How did you make your effort estimates?
We made our effort estimates based on both what is expected from what the issue says and our own expectation on our skill/if we already imagined an easy solution to the problem. For example, When making an entire page and making it functional. We expect it to take a lot more time than fixing/adding menial things, thus when estimating time, putting functionality on a page, especially when I had to add a searching functionality to it, would’ve taken a lot more time then fixing up small bugs or adding extra text to note cards.
## Even though your estimates were always off, sometimes way off, was there any benefit from making effort estimates for the issues in advance? If so, what benefits? If not, why not?
I think that these estimates would still help in judging scale. An issue with a lot of time expected would be assumed to be an especially hard problem to solve/ feature to implement. Would adding note card representations for every note in the database be harder to implement than a search feature? No, I think the search feature would be harder, especially because we have a template for note cards. I put the time to implement a search feature/functionality higher than the note cards. Of course it's not always accurate. Some bugs took way longer to fix than expected but in general, it was still a good indicator of the difficulty of the process more than anything.
## Was there any benefit for tracking the actual effort expended on the issues? If so, what benefits? If not, why not? Was there any downside to estimating and tracking your effort? If so what?
I don’t think there was really a huge benefit, especially while we were working. As the project goes on, some of the bigger issues require everyone to be working together instead of just having one person focused on the issue. In fact, in a way, everyone had a part to play in every part of the website, from the navbar to the pages to the database, everyone had their input, so to just have singular people take credit is a bit unfair. At the same time, it is obvious that when it comes to those aspects, one person would do most of the work with the others helping or putting their own finishing touches. I think how we went through doing this was overall pretty inaccurate to what actually happened while working on the site.
## How did you track your actual effort? How accurate do you believe your tracking was?
I tracked my actual effort by simply recalling and typing in how long I thought I took. Obviously a hard implementation would take more actual time and I always dedicate around 1-3 hours + class time every class day to the site so I would take that into account. I would admit that I don’t really keep track of how long I would work every day but I do believe my actual effort time was semi accurate to how long it actually took me to make the features.
## How much overhead was there in tracking your effort? Did it take up a noticeable amount of time or inhibit you working on the project?
I personally did not take a ton of time to keep track of my effort. Every milestone, our team would report our own progress and put it down on our project board. Maybe we could’ve spent more time keeping track of how long we worked on the project with timers and making sure we are consistent with how we estimate and return our total times but I know that would take more time out of working on the actual project. Overall this did not take as much time as we expected, maybe an extra 10-30 minutes of time at the end of every milestone to input and talk about what to do about this assignment but other than that it did not take a ton of time.
