Source is a video game engine created by Valve in 2004 to power and run mostly Valve made games. It includes a tool (Hammer) speicifcally made for making original maps or play spaces that you and other players can play in. In 2015, Source 2, the next iteration of the Source engine was released as new games were made with it and people (inckuding me) have used its version of Hammer with new technology to create new maps.

For years I have been making maps for various games in the Source engine and have published some of them in the link above. I have been able to think of ways to in a way, make my own fun for myself and others in different ways.
