Notehub Manoa is a website created by Milan Bukovics, Andrea Murilo, Catalina Barnes, Landon Kihe and Nalani Klopfen.

This site enables users to share various notes/material from their classes and specify what class,professor, and semester the material they are uploading is from so that other students in the future can search for that specifc class or even semester and access these notes.

It enables students to have an easy way to access notes /material for their specific class, without needing to go through sites that don't organize by what specific class or what professor was teaching the class when the note was made. This ensures that what is being given is only for that student's situation.
