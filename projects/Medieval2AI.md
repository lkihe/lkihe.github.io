Total War: Medieval 2 is a game made by The Creative Assembly and released in 2005. In it, you lead an already existing kingdom in medieval europe and try to dominate the map. The game features 2 distinct phases including the campaign map that has a top down view of your kingdom and other kingdoms and in which you are able to develop buildings, and interact (peacefully or with hostility) with other kingdoms, and the battle map in which 2 hostile armies fight against each other in a realistic simulation of large scale medieval combat.

The AI in this game, while able to participate in every game mechanic and play against the player, was lacking in challenge, as the AI would not know how to competently act in diplomacy with other AIs or with the human player, where they position their armies and how they fight the player were also flawed as a skilled player can easily out maneuver and defeat the AI in almost any situation if skilled enough. Not to mention the various little bugs the AI has that makes the experience feel broken at times

This is why I made AI changes in this game to address all of this in both phases of the game. In the campaign map, the AI is now able to interact with others in a more realistic way, complete with political backstabbing, mbeing able to defend against player made exploits, being able to notice and defend against preemminent attacks and more. In the battle map, the ai is able to counter and 

Unlike the Age of Empires 4 mod, this is not published. Mostly because my changes are branched off of another mod, making this a submod technically.
