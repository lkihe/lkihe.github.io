Total War: Medieval 2 is a game made by The Creative Assembly and released in 2005. In it, you lead an already existing kingdom in medieval europe and try to dominate the map. The game features 2 distinct phases including the campaign map that has a top down view of your kingdom and other kingdoms and in which you are able to develop buildings and armies and the battle map in which 2 hostile armies fight against each other in a realistic simulation of large scale medieval combat.
