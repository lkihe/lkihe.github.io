In 2021, the game Age of Empires 4 released and was published by Microsoft. The game was good but what I felt was the worst part of the game was the game's official AI. It did not know how to use some of the mechanics, it was easy to break and exploit, the AI was flat out unable to play some of the factions at any level, and most of all, it was easy to beat in a match. The hardest AI in the game was comparable to a person who just started playing and wanted to win. Even though the developers released updates to make the AI play better I thought I could be able to improve it myself. So I made and shared my own mod for the game dedicated to only fixing and tweaking the AI to make it able to play better against a human and fix long standing bugs.

I shared Jakcie AI to the wider Age of Empires 4 community on 2023 and have been updating the mod since to keep up with game updates and add small changes to further improve the AI. The mod currently stands with thousands of current downloads and I was able to gather a very small community of people on the game's forum to disscuss and anticipate the next time I update the mod.
